# Functional-tests
Initial evaluation of GitHub
_I guess this file uses markdown by default._
If this is the case, *this* could be in bold and _that_ would be italics.
No?
How about #this# in bold, then?
Neither.

Ok let's try
# title 1
## title 2
### title 3
They appear in bold.

Does it indent / chromacode directly for C? Allman-style? 1TBF?
static myFunction (int myParam)
{
    return myParam;
}

No cigar...
